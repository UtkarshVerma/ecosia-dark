# Ecosia-Darker Theme

**Ecosia-Darker** is a dark theme for [Ecosia](https://www.ecosia.org), an eco-friendly search engine. [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com)'s dark theme has been used as a reference for this theme, therefore the end-result is quite similar to DuckDuckGo(which was intentional).
